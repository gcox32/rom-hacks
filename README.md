# Gen I Rom Hacks


## True Blue
The goal was to give the player a chance to play as Blue. This can be as simple as swapping the overworld sprites or as complicated as rewriting all the dialogue and refactoring the rival interactions. A lot of this is simple text replacement, but the Assembly modifications on some of the overworld stuff is hairy. [The Changelog](https://github.com/gcox32/rom-hacks/blob/main/blue/CHANGELOG.md) is not up-to-date. Check out specifics [here](https://github.com/gcox32/rom-hacks/blob/main/blue/README.md).

The TODO list can be found [here](https://github.com/gcox32/rom-hacks/blob/main/blue/TODO.md).

## Red
I didn't change anything. This is a disassembly of Pokemon Red. Checkout the README [here](https://github.com/gcox32/rom-hacks/blob/main/red/README.md).

## Yellow
The goal _will_ be, one day, to add a second, and then a third follower to the overworld (i.e. Misty and then Brock). If I can figure that out, I'll make the game as much like the anime as possible, including reconfiguring the map where necessary and inserting any key characters. The follower implementation will be a mountain though. Checkout the README [here](https://github.com/gcox32/rom-hacks/blob/main/yellow/README.md).
